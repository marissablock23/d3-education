         <h1 class = "text title"> Is Education a Binding Constraint to Economic Growth? </h1>
    <p> The purpose of this tool is to analyze human capital and determine if it is a binding constraint to economic growth, using the growth diagnostics methodology <a href="https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/growth-diagnostics-0"> (Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco, 2005)</a>. Economic growth requires private investment and entrepreneurship. Growth may be constrained due to low returns to economic activities or a high cost of finance. Furthermore, low returns may be a result of low appropriability, meaning investments are profitable, but investors cannot access those reuturns, or returns are low due to low social returns. Education, and human capital more broadly, falls under the branch of low social returns. A full analysis requires an investigation into all branches of the growth diagnostic tree.</p>
    
    <h2 class = "text subtitle"> What is a binding constraint? </h2>
    
    <p> At a basic level, a binding constraint is a factor or condition that is supply constrainted relative to demand. The growth diagnostics methodology uses four tests to analyze the supply and demand dynamics: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Is the price of the factor high? </li>
      <li> Do changes in the availability correlate with aggregate changes in investment or growth?</li>
      <li> Do economic agents attempt to circumvent the constraint? </li>
      <li> Are individuals or businesses that rely on the constraining factor unable to prosper? </li>
    </ol> 
    <p> In addition to the above mentioned tests, it is also important to benchmark the information against other countries.</p>

      <p> This tool aims to explain what a binding constraint in education might look like, while enabling the user to explore a particular country of interest. At present, the tool allows the user to benchmark education and explore and analyze the data related to the first test.
      <br><br>
      Begin by selecting a country of interest, which will be highlighted in the graphs below. You can change the selected country at any time and the graphs will update based on your selection.

        <h2 class = "text subtitle"> Benchmarking Education </h2>
        <p>First, we benchmark the quantity of schooling using the average years of schooling as our measure of attainment. This value comes from the <a href="http://www.barrolee.com/"> Barro-Lee dataset</a>, which provides country-level years of schooling estimates from 1950 to 2010. This data is pulled from the World Bank's Education Statistics database. The scatter plot exhibits a strong, positive relationship between GDP per capita and years of schooling. Where does your country stand? Is it a positive outlier, like Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, which have higher than expected years of schooling given their level of GDP? Or is it a negative outlier, like Senegal and Mali, which have relatively low years of schooling given their GDP. Another aspect of the analysis is to compare your selected country with its regional and income group comparators.
        </p>

        <p>Educational attainment has increased tremendously, and most countries see high levels of enrollment, especially at the primary level. The arguably more important indicator is quality. Here, quality is measured by test scores. <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/706141516721172989/pdf/WPS8314.pdf"> Altinok, Angrist and Patrinos (2018)</a> provide a global data set of harmonized test scores, allowing us to compare different international and regional test across more countries, including developing ones. Similar to quantity, there is a strong positive relationship between GDP and test scores. The approach to the analysis is the same as in the quantity benchmarking, namely: Does your selected country have higher than expected or lower than expected test scores given its level of GDP?</p>

        <h2 class = "text subtitle"> Test 1: Are returns to schooling high? </h2>
        <p> If education is supply constrained relative to demand, we might expect to see a high price, which is measured as returns to schooling. More simply, if laborers are in short supply due to lack of education, we would expect to see high returns. Depending on the context of your selected country, you may be more concerned with overall returns, returns to higher education, or returns disaggregated by sex, among others. Additionally, lack of education might mean lack of high-quality education (i.e there are many graduates, but the quality of their degree is poor), or lack of quantity (there just aren't enough graduates).

        In a recent review of the literature on returns to schooling, <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/442521523465644318/pdf/WPS8402.pdf"> Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2018)</a> provide a comprehensive database on returns and highlight the latest trends and patterns. Does your selected country have high returns? The following should be kept in mind, when analyzing your country of interest: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> The private average global rate of return to one extra year of schooling is 9 percent. This value is very stable over decades. </li>
          <li> Private returns to higher education have increased over time. </li>
          <li> Women experience higher average returns. </li>
          <li> Returns to schooling are generally higher in low-income countries. </li>
        </ul>
          <p>Note, graphs are generated based on the country selected.</p>
