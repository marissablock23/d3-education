    <h1 class = "text title"> Is Education a Binding Constraint to Economic Growth? </h1>
    <p> The purpose of this tool is to analyze human capital and determine if it is a binding constraint to economic growth, using the growth diagnostics methodology <a href="https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/growth-diagnostics-0"> (Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco, 2005)</a>. Economic growth requires private investment and entrepreneurship. Growth may be constrained due to low returns to economic activities or a high cost of finance. Furthermore, low returns may be a result of low appropriability, meaning investments are profitable, but investors cannot access those reuturns, or returns are low due to low social returns. Education, and human capital more broadly, falls under the branch of low social returns. A full analysis requires an investigation into all branches of the growth diagnostic tree.</p>
    
    <h2 class = "text subtitle"> What is a binding constraint? </h2>
    
    <p> At a basic level, a binding constraint is a factor or condition that is supply constrainted relative to demand. The growth diagnostics methodology uses four tests to analyze the supply and demand dynamics: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Is the price of the factor high? </li>
      <li> Do changes in the availability correlate with aggregate changes in investment or growth?</li>
      <li> Do economic agents attempt to circumvent the constraint? </li>
      <li> Are individuals or businesses that rely on the constraining factor unable to prosper? </li>
    </ol>  
    <p>
    In addition to the above mentioned tests, it is also important to benchmark the information against other countries. <br><br>
    This tool aims to explain what a binding constraint in education might look like, while enabling the user to explore a particular country of interest.

        <p>First, we benchmark the quantity of schooling using the average years of schooling as our measure of attainment. This value comes from the <a href="http://www.barrolee.com/"> Barro-Lee dataset</a>, which provides country-level years of schooling estimates from 1950 to 2010. This data is pulled from the World Bank's Education Statistics database. <br> <br>
        The scatter plot exhibits a strong, positive relationship between GDP per capita and years of schooling. Note that the logarithm of GDP per capita is taken. We can observe that countries like Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic have higher than expected years of schooling, given their level of GDP. In contrast, countries like Senegal and Mali stand out as having relatively low years of schooling, given their GDP.

        <p>Educational attainment has increased tremendously, and most countries see high levels of enrollment, especially at the primary level. The arguably more important indicator is quality. Here, quality is measured by test scores. <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/706141516721172989/pdf/WPS8314.pdf"> Altinok, Angrist and Patrinos (2018)</a> provide a global data set of harmonized test scores, allowing us to compare different international and regional test across more countries, including developing countries.</p>

        <h2 class = "text subtitle"> Test 1: Are returns to schooling high? </h2>
        <p> If education is supply constrained relative to demand, we might expect to see a high returns to schooling. Depending on the country of interest, we may think of supply in a number of ways: number of secondary school graduates or number of graduates with technical degrees. </p>

        <p> In a recent review of the literature on returns to schooling, <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/442521523465644318/pdf/WPS8402.pdf"> Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2018)</a> highlight the latest trends and patterns. The following should be kept in mind, when analyzing your country of interest: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> The private average global rate of return to one extra year of schooling is 9 percent. This value is very stable over decades. </li>
          <li> Private returns to higher education have increased over time. </li>
          <li> Women experience higher average returns. </li>
          <li> Returns to schooling are generally higher in low-income countries. </li>
        </ul>
